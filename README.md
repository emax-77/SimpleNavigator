# Simple navigation app for Android created in .NET MAUI
## Set your destination and follow an intuitive compass-like arrow that continuously points you in the right direction.
### Perfect for use cases like:
- locating your parked car in a huge parking lot :)
- also ideal for hikers and geocachers

### Works offline - no internet access required. You need to allow GPS only.
***---The app is still in development. New features like multilanguage support should be available in January 2026---***
