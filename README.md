# Simple navigation app for Android created in .NET MAUI with C#
## Save your destination location; the navigation will guide you to it using the rotating arrow (like a compass).
### Suitable for cases like "Find my car". Or it can help you find the starting/target location on your hiking trip.
***The app is still in the early stages of development. New features will be available soon***
